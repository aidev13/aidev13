## David Liebherr
I strive to have a deeper understanding of the orignal world of web development.

"...many young web developers began their careers by building React.js applications that interact with a Node server using a JSON API; they may never have learned about hypermedia as a system at all.
This is a tragedy, and, frankly, a failure on the part of the thought leaders in the web development community to properly communicate and advocate for the hypermedia approach.
I am a self-learning dev, and I graduated from UW-Wisconsin extended program in full stack web development."
-HYPERMEDIA SYSTEMS

I have hands on experience with HTML, CSS, JS, PHP, Python, MySql - ReactJS, HTMX, Express, NodeJS, Bootstrap, and some others. I often forget. So, I code aften.
