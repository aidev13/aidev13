- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m David Liebherr!

I enjoy coding in PHP and JavaScript. I have also been dabbing in C#.

I am a self-learning dev. I did graduate EdX bootcamp in full stack web development. During this adventure, I learned I love to help and share what I know, and asking questions - A LOT of questions! 

I have become a better person through coding. I hope to share my joy with others. 

If you made it this far, I am working on a dice baseball game I have created on my own in Javascript. I also, have a webapp project that will unite landowners and hunters together, creating a more safe, managable experience for both parties.

Also, in the future, I will be working on a game built in unity with my brother, who is a animation designer, about biblical adventures!
